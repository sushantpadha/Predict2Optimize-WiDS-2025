# Week 4 - Portfolio Optimization: From Markowitz to Robust Convex Formulations

In this week we dive into the heart of modern portfolio theory and with brief discussion on convex optimization theory.

This week is quite theoretical, along with programming tasks to help you evaluate your understanding and to help you "see" the computation and interpret its results.

Please go through the resources in the following order:
1. `README.ipynb` to cover the basic theory.
2. `intro_to_cvxpy.ipynb` to cover some code examples.
3. `task4.ipynb` to look at the theory + programming tasks for this week.

References and resources are mentioned within the relevant sections. In case of any doubts please ask on the group.

This will not be required for the midterm submission.
