# Week 101 :)

This is the **final week** of the project.

Here, we bring everything together and build a **complete portfolio management pipeline** - from data and prediction to optimization and backtesting.  

You've done all the work - this week involves plugging in all the parts together and hope it your code does what we expect it to do!

---

## What to do (in order)

1. **Read `readme.ipynb`**  
   This explains what *backtesting* means, common pitfalls (look-ahead bias, overtrading, survivorship bias), and the overall design of our implementation.

2. **Go through `howto.ipynb`**  
   This notebook contains skeleton code, demos, and TODOs to help you build your own strategy.

3. **Skim the helper files**  
   - `helpers.py` and `backtesting_utils.py` contain plotting and other utility functions.  
   - Don’t worry about their internals - examples of how to use them are shown in `howto.ipynb`.

4. **Build your own strategy in `task5.ipynb`**  
   Combine:
   - a predictor,
   - a portfolio optimizer,
   - a rebalancing rule,
   - and a backtest.

   The strategy doesn’t have to be complex, but it should be *yours*. Make whatever decisions seem fit to you and choose your favourite universe of stocks.

Thanks for sticking with the project till the end — hope you enjoyed building your own portfolio system.
